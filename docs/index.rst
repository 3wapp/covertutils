Welcome to CovertUtils's documentation!
=======================================

This Project is free and open-source, available @

A Blog post about it, explaining *motivation* and *implementation internals* is located in my personal blog:

As the *covertutils API* Toc-Tree is **huge** (due to the *single-module=single-class* code organizing), it is really handy to use the **search page** of sphinx.
